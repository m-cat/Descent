#Descent

##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-12-2014)

Added items back in and set up a parser for the items.conf file. Now adding a new item to the game is as easy as editing that file. Also implemented an inventory, a rudimentary inventory display screen, and the ability to pick up and drop items. Also added messages. 

###To Do

####General

- Add enemies

- Add dungeon generation

- Continue work on the menu and UI

####Misc

- Make messages look nicer, add support for multi-line messages.

- Implement scrolling through items in the inventory and picking up specific items from the ground.
