#Descent

##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-10-2014)

Rewrote much of the code to use the libtcod library. The game looks and feels much nicer as a result, and I now have access to useful things like generic lists. Temporarily took out items while I figure out how to use libtcod's config file parser. All items, monsters, NPCs, etc. will be defined in external config files.

###To Do

####General

- Add items back in

- Improve the cave generation and add another cave gen algorithm

- Add dungeon generation

- Implement items, and inventory

- Continue work on the menu and UI
