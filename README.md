#Descent

##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-6-2014)

Began implementing the menu and UI. Implemented an input function which still has a bug associated with it. Restructured the structure of the code a little bit.

###To Do

####General

- Add dungeon generation

- Continue work on the menu and UI

####Misc

- Fix a bug that occurs when the console is resized while inside cinput().

- Begin thinking about monster movement order
