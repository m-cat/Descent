#Descent

##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-11-2014)

Setting up the file parser is taking longer than it should, due to libtcod's incomplete documentation. In the meantime I worked on improving dungeon generation and added two new features - the ability to scroll (hold the ctrl key) and the ability to examine features on the grid (press x).

###To Do

- Add items back in
