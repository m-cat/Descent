## What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Current State (2-27-2017)

This project is likely discontinued. I intend to start a new game from scratch, using a different language, more organized code, and fewer initial features/scope.

### To Do

#### General

- Equipment screen

- Enemy AI

- Have walls drop gems with low chance when mined.

- Add dungeon generation

- Add river & lake generation (using heightmaps)

- Continue work on the menu and UI

#### Misc

- Implement picking up specific items from the ground.
