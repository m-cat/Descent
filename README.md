##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-15-2014)

Made a lot of progress on the inventory system. You can now scroll through the inventory to drop or wield specific items.

Added a rat as the first enemy. Still need to work on AI.

Nice-looking line-wrapping message system completed.

Some visual improvements were made.

###To Do

####General

- Equipment screen

- Enemy AI

- Have walls drop gems with low chance when mined.

- Add dungeon generation

- Add river & lake generation (using heightmaps)

- Continue work on the menu and UI

####Misc
