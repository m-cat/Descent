#Descent

##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-4-2014)

Development began today. Curses was chosen as the library for console interactions - the game will have to later be ported to Windows with pdcurses. Currently there is a basic structure in place for the dungeon and its representation in memory. A maze generator was programmed to test this structure - that is why a maze appears when the game is run.
