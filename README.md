##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-21-2014)

Been too busy to work on major features. However, a lot of the code has been simplified or improved, some bugs have been fixed, and some minor things have been implemented.

###To Do

####General

- Equipment screen

- Enemy AI

- Have walls drop gems with low chance when mined.

- Add dungeon generation

- Add river & lake generation (using heightmaps)

- Continue work on the menu and UI

####Misc

- Implement picking up specific items from the ground.
