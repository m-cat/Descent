#Descent

##What is Descent?

Descent is a work-in-progress [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game. It will differ from most convential roguelikes by foregoing archaic and dated gameplay and instead offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

##Current State (3-9-2014)

Began implementing items. They can be placed in stashes on the ground and the top one viewed. Still to be implemented are picking items up and an inventory. Also added a water type tile and a structure for furniture (i.e. doors), but haven't tested them yet.

###To Do

####General

- Add dungeon generation
